# Advanced-system-task-manager_os-project
This project presents the design and implementation of an Advanced System Task
Manager using C++, developed in Dev C++. The application simulates the core functionalities
of a real-world operating system task manager, allowing users to create, monitor, manipulate,
and persistently store simulated tasks (processes). The project demonstrates key concepts in
process management, resource tracking, object-oriented programming, and file handling in
C++.
